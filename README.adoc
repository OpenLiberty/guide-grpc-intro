Learn how to use gRPC unary calls, server streaming, client streaming, and bidirectional streaming to communicate between client and server services in Open Liberty.

// ===============================================================================================
//  What you'll learn
// ===============================================================================================

== What is gRPC?

The https://grpc.io/[gRPC^] Remote Procedure Call is a technology that implements remote procedure call (RPC) style APIs with HTTP/2. gRPC uses https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview[protocol buffers^] to define its routines, which include service calls and expected messages. For each service defined in a `.proto` file, gRPC uses the definition to generate the skeleton code for users to implement and extend. Protocol buffers use a binary format to send and receive messages that is faster and more lightweight than the JSON that is typically used in RESTful APIs.

Protocol buffers allow cross-project support through the `.proto` file. As a result, gRPC clients and servers can run and communicate with each other from different environments. For example, a gRPC client running in Java codebase is able to call a gRPC server from other https://grpc.io/docs/languages/[supported languages^]. This feature of protocol buffers allows for easier integration between services.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to create gRPC services and their clients by using protocol buffers and how to implement them with Open Liberty. You will use Maven to generate the gRPC stubs, deploy the services, and to interact with the running Liberty server.

The application that you will build in this guide consists of the `systemproto` model project, the `query` client service, and the `system` server service. The `query` service implements four RESTful APIs by using four different gRPC streaming methods.

* Unary RPC: The client sends a single request and recieves a single response.
* Server streaming RPC: The client sends and single request and the server returns a stream of messages.
* Client streaming RPC: The client sends a stream of messages and the server responds with a single message.
* Bidirectional RPC: Both client and server sned a stream of messages and the client and server can read and write messages in any order.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root of this guide contains the finished application. Give it a try before you proceed.

To try out the application, first go to the `finish` directory and run the following Maven goal to generate all the gRPC abstract classes defined in the `.proto` file. 

// generate gRPC classes
[role='command']
----
cd finish
mvn -pl systemproto install
----

Start the `system` service by running the following command:
// starting system
[role='command']
----
mvn -pl system liberty:run
----

Next, open another command-line session, navigate to the `finish` directory, and start the `query` service by using the following command:
// starting query
[role='command']
----
mvn -pl query liberty:run
----

Wait until you see the `The defaultServer server is ready to run a smarter planet` message in your consoles. Then, point your browser to the http://localhost:9081/query/properties/os.name URL to test out the basic unary service. You will see your operating system name. Next, point your browser to the following URLs to try out the corresponding streaming rpc call: 

* Visit http://localhost:9081/query/properties/os to test out the server streaming. The details of your localhost operating system are displayed.

* Visit http://localhost:9081/query/properties/user to test out the client streaming. The details of your localhost user properties are displayed. 

* Visit http://localhost:9081/query/properties/java to test out the bidirectional streaming. The details of your localhost Java properties are displayed.
endif::[]
// cloud hosted instruction

Click the following button to visit the ***/query/properties/os.name*** endpoint to test out the basic unary service. You will see your operating system name.  

::startApplication{port="9081" display="external" name="/query/properties/os.name" route="/query/properties/os.name"}

Next, click the following button to visit the ***/query/properties/os*** endpoint to test out the server streaming. The details of your localhost operating system are displayed.

::startApplication{port="9081" display="external" name="/query/properties/os" route="/query/properties/os"}

Visit the ***/query/properties/user*** endpoint to test out the client streaming. The details of your localhost user properties are displayed.  

::startApplication{port="9081" display="external" name="/query/properties/user" route="/query/properties/user"}

Visit the ***/query/properties/java*** endpoint to test out the bidirectional streaming. The details of your localhost Java properties are displayed.

::startApplication{port="9081" display="external" name="/query/properties/java" route="/query/properties/java"}
endif::[]

Observe the output from the consoles running the `system` and `query` services.

After you are finished checking out the application, stop both the `query` and `system` services by pressing `CTRL+C` in the command-line sessions where you ran them. Alternatively, you can run the following goals from the `finish` directory in another command-line session:
// stopping dev mode

== Creating and defining the gRPC service

Navigate to the `start` directory to begin.

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-grpc-intro/start
```
endif::[]

First, create the `.proto` file and generate gRPC classes. You will implement the gRPC server with the generated classes later. The `.proto` file defines all the service calls and message types. The message types are used in the service call definition for the parameters and returns.

// Create SystemProto.proto
[role="code_command hotspot file=0", subs="quotes"]
----
#Create the `SystemService.proto` file.#
`systemproto/src/main/proto/SystemService.proto`
----
SystemService.proto

----
include::finish/systemproto/src/main/proto/SystemService.proto[]
----

// Import pom.xml
pom.xml
[source, XML, linenums, role="code_column"]
----
include::finish/systemproto/pom.xml[]
----

The first few lines define the [hotspot=basicConfig file=0]`syntax`, [hotspot=basicConfig file=0]`package`, and [hotspot=basicConfig file=0]`option` basic configuration of the `.proto` file. The [hotspot=SystemService file=0]`SystemService` service contains the four service calls that you will implement in the coming sections.

The [hotspot=getProperty file=0]`getProperty` rpc defines the unary call. In this call, the client side sends a `SystemPropertyName` message to the server side, which returns a `SystemPropertyValue` message with the property value. The [hotspot=SystemPropertyName file=0]`SystemPropertyName` and [hotspot=SystemPropertyValue file=0]`SystemPropertyValue` message types define that the `propertyName` and `propertyValue` must be string.

The [hotspot=getPropertiesServer file=0]`getPropertiesServer` rpc defines the server streaming call. The client side sends a `SystemPropertyPrefix` message to the server side. The server returns a stream of `SystemProperty` messages. Each [hotspot=SystemProperty file=0]`SystemProperty` message contains `propertyName` and `propertyValue` strings.

The [hotspot=getPropertiesClient file=0]`getPropertiesClient` rpc defines the client streaming call. The client side streams `SystemPropertyName` messages to the server side. The server returns a [hotspot=SystemProperties file=0]`SystemProperties` message that contains a map of the properties with their respective values.


The [hotspot=getPropertiesBidirect file=0]`getPropertiesBidirect` rpc defines the bidirectional streaming call. In this service, the client side streams `SystemPropertyName` messages to the server side. The server returns a stream of [hotspot=SystemProperty file=0]`SystemProperty` messages.

To compile the `.proto` file, the `pom.xml` Maven configuration file needs the  [hotspot=grpc file=1]`grpc-protobuf` and [hotspot=grpc-stub file=1]`grpc-stub` dependencies, and the [hotspot=protobufmavenplugin file=1]`protobuf-maven-plugin` plugin. To install the correct version of the Protobuf compiler automatically, the [hotspot=osmavenplugin file=1]`os-maven-plugin` extension is required in the `build` configuration.

Run the following command to generate the gRPC classes.
// run mvn install to generate abstract classes
[role='command']
----
mvn -pl systemproto install

== Implementing the unary call

Navigate to the `start` directory.

// cloud-hosted guide instructions:
ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
```bash
cd /home/project/draft-guide-grpc-intro/start
```
endif::[]

When you run Open Liberty in https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/development-mode.html[dev mode^], the server listens for file changes and automatically recompiles and deploys your updates whenever you save a new change. Run the following command to start the `system` service in dev mode:

// start dev mode for system
[role='command']
```
mvn -pl system liberty:dev
```

Open another command-line session, navigate to the `start` directory, and run the following command to start the `query` service in dev mode:

// start dev mode for query
[role='command']
```
mvn -pl query liberty:dev
```

After you see the following message, your application servers in dev mode are ready:

[role="no_copy"]
----
**************************************************************
*    Liberty is running in dev mode.
----

Dev mode holds your command-line session to listen for file changes. Open another command-line session and navigate to the `start` directory to continue, or open the project in your editor.

Start by implementing the first service call, the unary call. In this service call, the `query` client service sends a property to the `system` server service, which returns the property value. This type of service call resembles a RESTful API. 

// Create SystemService

----

The `SystemService` class implements the `SystemServiceGrpc` class that is generated by the `.proto` file. The four types of services defined in the proto file are implemented in this class.

The [hotspot=getProperty file=0]`getProperty()` method implements the rpc unary call defined in the `.proto` file. The [hotspot=pName file=0]`getPropertyName()` getter method that is generated by gRPC retrieves the property name from the client, and stores it into the `pName` variable. The System property value is stored into the [hotspot=pValue file=0]`pValue` variable. The gRPC APIs will create a [hotspot=response file=0]`SystemPropertyValue` message, with its type defined in the `SystemService.proto` file. Then, the message is sent to the client service through the `StreamObserver` by using its [hotspot=next file=0]`onNext()` and [hotspot=complete file=0]`onComplete()` methods.

Add the [hotspot=grpc file=1]`grpc` feature to the Liberty server configuration file. This feature enables compatibility between the gRPC server and the Liberty server. Configure the [hotspot=grpcConfig file=1]`grpc` feature with the `target` attribute. If you want to learn more about `grpc` feature configuration, see the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/grpc.html[GRPC Server Properties^].

Next, implement the RESTful endpoint in the `query` service.

----
include::finish/query/src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/query/PropertiesResource.java[]
----
The `PropertiesResource` class provides RESTful endpoints to interact with the `system` service. The [hotspot=unary file=2]`/query/properties/${property}` endpoint uses the unary service call to get the property value from the `system` service. The endpoint creates a [hotspot=createChannel1 file=2]`channel`, , which it uses to create a client by the [hotspot=createClient1 file=2]`SystemServiceGrpc.newBlockingStub()` API. The endpoiint then uses the client to get the property value, shuts down the channel, and immediately returns the value from the `system` service response.

// update server.xml

----

Add the [hotspot=grpc file=3]`grpc` and [hotspot=grpcClient file=3]`grpcClient` features to the Liberty query server configuration file. Both features enable gRPC server and client compatibility with the Liberty server. Configure the [hotspot=grpcClientConfig file=3]`grpcClient` feature with the `headersToPropagate` and `target` attributes. If you want to learn more about `grpcClient` feature configuration, see the https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/config/grpcClient.html[GRPC Client Properties^].

Because you are running the `system` and `query` services in dev mode, the changes that you made were automatically picked up. You’re now ready to check out your application in your browser.

// ===============================================================================================

== Implementing the server streaming call

In the server streaming call, the `query` client service provides the `/query/properties/os` endpoint that sends a message to the `system` server service. The `system` service streams the properties started with `os.` back to the `query` service. A channel is created between the `query` and the `system` services to stream messages. The channel is closed by the `system` service only after sending the last message to the `query` service.

The [hotspot=getPropertiesServer file=0]`getPropertiesServer()` method implements server streaming rpc call. The [hotspot=prefix file=0]`getPropertyPrefix()` getter method retrieves the property prefix from the client. Properties that start with the [hotspot=filter file=0]`prefix` are filtered out. For each property, a [hotspot=serverMessage file=0]`SystemProperty` message is built and streamed to the client through the `StreamObserver` by using its [hotspot=serverNext1 file=0]`onNext()` method. When all properties are streamed, the service stops streaming by calling the [hotspot=serverComplete file=0]`onComplete()` method.

Update the `PropertiesResource` class to implement the `/query/properties/os` endpoint of the `query` service.

// Replace PropertiesResource

The endpoint creates a [hotspot=createChannel2 file=1]`channel` to the `system` service and a [hotspot=createClient2 file=1]`client` by using the `SystemServiceGrpc.newStub()` API. Then, it calls the [hotspot=getPropertiesServer file=1]`getPropertiesServer()` method with an implementation of the `StreamObserver` interface. The [hotspot=onNext1 file=1]`onNext()` method receives messages streaming from the server individually and stores them into the `properties` placeholder. After all properties are received, the `system` service shuts down the [hotspot=closeConnection file=1]`channel` and returns the placeholder. Because the rpc call is asynchronous, a [hotspot=countDownLatch1 hotspot=countDownLatch2 hotspot=countDownLatch3 file=1]`CountDownLatch` instance synchronizes the streaming flow.

// ===============================================================================================


== Implementing the client streaming call

In the client streaming call, the `query` client service provides the `/query/properties/user` endpoint, which streams the user properties to the `system` server service. The `system` service returns a map of user properties with their values.

Update the `SystemService` class to implement the client streaming rpc call.

The [hotspot=getPropertiesClient file=0]`getPropertiesClient()` method implements client streaming rpc call. This method returns an instance of the [hotspot=streamObserverClient file=0]`StreamObserver` interface. Its [hotspot=receivingProperties file=0]`onNext()` method receives the messages from the client individually and stores the property values into the [hotspot=clientStreamingMap file=0]`properties` map placeholder. When the streaming is completed, the `properties` placeholder is sent back to the client by the [hotspot=clientStreamingCompleted file=0]`onCompleted()` method.


// Replace PropertiesResource
Update the `PropertiesResource` class to implement the `/query/properties/user` endpoint of the query service.

After a connection is created between the two services, the [hotspot=getPropertiesClient file=1]`client.getPropertiesClient()` method is called to get a `stream` and collect the properties with property names that are prefixed by [hotspot=collectUserProperties file=1]`user.`. The method creates a [hotspot=clientMessage1 file=1]`SystemPropertyName` message individually and sends the message to the server by the [hotspot=streamOnNext1 file=1]`stream::onNext` action. When all property names are sent, the [hotspot=clientCompleted1 file=1]`onCompleted()` method is called to finish the streaming. Again, a [hotspot=countDownLatch4 hotspot=countDownLatch5 hotspot=countDownLatch6 file=1]`CountDownLatch` instance synchronizes the streaming flow.

// ===============================================================================================

== Implementing the bidirectional streaming call

In the bidirectional streaming call, the `query` client service provides the `/query/properties/java` endpoint, which streams the property names that start with `java.` to the `system` server service. The `system` service streams the property values back to the `query` service.

Update the `SystemService` class to implement the bidirectional streaming rpc call.

The [hotspot=getPropertiesBidirect file=0]`getPropertiesBidirect()` method implements bidirectional streaming rpc call. This method returns an instance of the [hotspot=streamObserverBidirectional file=0]`StreamObserver` interface. Its [hotspot=receiveBidirectionalProperties file=0]`onNext()` method receives the messages from the client individually, creates a [hotspot=systemPropertyMessage file=0]`SystemProperty` message with the property name and value, and sends the message back to the client. When the client streaming is completed, the method closes the server streaming by calling the [hotspot=bidirectionalCompleted file=0]`onCompleted()` method.

For each property name that starts with [hotspot=collectJavaProperties file=1]`java.`, a [hotspot=clientMessage2 file=1]`SystemPropertyName` message is created and sent to the server by the [hotspot=streamOnNext2 file=1]`stream::onNext` action. When all property names are sent, the streaming is finished by calling the [hotspot=clientCompleted2 file=1]`onCompleted()` method.
